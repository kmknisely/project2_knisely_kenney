        <h2> Our Liturgy </h2>

        <p>The words and prayers we use at Church of the Beloved come from the Book of Common Prayer, which is the standard prayer book used by the Episcopal Church.  Each week we share Holy Communion (bread and wine) as part of our worship together. Our service will be mostly the same each week: we hear readings from Scripture, a sermon from Meaghan or a guest preacher, a series of prayers, and then the celebration of Communion. The music changes from week to week, but after a few weeks the cadence of the service should start to feel familiar to you. </p>

        <p>While the history of our service is extensive, we try to keep the worship experience simple and informal. We are reverent in our worship, but also understand our own humanity and laugh at ourselves easily and often.  We want people to feel spiritually challenged by our worship, but to also feel comfortable and authentic coming and being part of the Beloved family just as they are. </p>

        <h2> Our Music </h2>

        <p>At Beloved members of our church family provide simple and beautiful music to accompany and enhance our worship experience. Most of our music is more contemporary in nature, but we also use some of the more simple hymns from the Episcopal Church Hymnal. </p>

        <p> Members of our congregation provide the leadership in our music, and we are blessed by the many years the people in our community have leading music and worship at other churches. They use piano, guitar, and hand drum along with their beautiful voices to lead us in song.  Our musicians are volunteer, so occasionally we don't have musicians at church, and we raise a joyful noise in other ways!</p>

        <h2> Beloved Family </h2>

        <p> Children make up a large part of our congregation at Beloved, and they are valued members of our community. We are also blessed by the presence of many teenagers who often enhance our music with their leadership and talents. </p>

        <p> Because children are so welcome, our worship reflects their presence. Some evenings the chorus of small voices can be heard as a back drop to our service, and interruptions to the liturgy are not unheard of. We try to incorporate songs that children enjoy, and we understand when they have trouble staying in their seats for long periods of time. We want everyone to feel comfortable and at home. </p>

        <p> Each week we share a potluck dinner after church, which adds to our family atmosphere. Bringing a dish is not a requirement, but we hope you will join us for some food. Somehow there is always enough!</p>
